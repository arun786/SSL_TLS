# Encryption Algorithm


## Symmetric key algorithm

DES - length of the key is 56 bits
3DES - it does encryption 3 times one after the other

The above 2 algorithms are obsolete
 

AES - Advanced Encryption System, allows you to keys of different length. AES256, length of 256 bits.

AES - Is most secure and most modern

RSA - is an Asymmetric key
